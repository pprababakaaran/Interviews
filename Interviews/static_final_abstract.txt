Static Variables, Methods
Final Variabales, Methods, Class
Abstract Methods, Class
synchronized Methods - The synchronized key word used to indicate that a method can be accessed by only one thread at a time.
transient Variabales - An instance variable is marked transient to indicate the JVM to skip the particular variable when serializing the object containing it.
volatile Variabales - The volatile is used to let the JVM know that a thread accessing the variable must always merge its own private copy of the variable with the master copy in the memory.

Public Class,
Public abstract Class - Class should be extended
Public Final Class - Class can't be extended

The synchronized Modifier:
The synchronized key word used to indicate that a method can be accessed by only one thread at a time. The synchronized modifier can be applied with any of the four access level modifiers.

The transient Modifier:
An instance variable is marked transient to indicate the JVM to skip the particular variable when serializing the object containing it.

This modifier is included in the statement that creates the variable, preceding the class or data type of the variable.

The abstract Modifier:
abstract Class:
An abstract class can never be instantiated. If a class is declared as abstract then the sole purpose is for the class to be extended.

abstract Methods:
An abstract method is a method declared with out any implementation. The methods body(implementation) is provided by the subclass. Abstract methods can never be final or strict.
