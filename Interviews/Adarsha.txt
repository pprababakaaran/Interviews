    2.Implement a Thread pool
    3.Given a v huge list of integers, multiply every element in the list by 2.(mylti threading) list.stream().parallel().foreach(this:doSomething);
	 or List<Integer> resultNumbers = IntStream.range(0,100)
            .parallel()
            .map(i->i*MUTIPLY_ELEMENT)

     How do you manage session details of the recent 10 most   active users? Which are the collections you use for this?
	 you can use a Queue = linked list implementation to fetch most recent users
	  Given a set of transactions done by a person, it can   reach a server in different order. Had to come up with a solution to maintain all transactions done by a person in the order it was done though transactions may arrive out of order.
	  Simple soultion using min-heap and sequence numbers
